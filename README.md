### 👋🏻 Hello! I'm Andres Hoyos Garcia

🚀 I entered the field of web development at the beginning of 2023. Since then I have participated in various projects that have allowed me to refine my technical skills and make a valuable contribution to my company, always focusing on the user experience and the requirements of the customer. I achieve this by paying special attention to the optimization of functionalities, always looking for ways to improve their performance.

💡 In my experience I have also had the opportunity to strengthen my soft skills by participating in multidisciplinary teams, maintaining effective communication and working with agility.

🌱 For my future I hope to explore new challenges, and continue contributing to the success of web projects as I grow in the field of web development and discover new technologies.
