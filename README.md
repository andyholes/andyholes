### 👋🏻 Hello! I'm Andres Hoyos Garcia

📆 In 2019 I graduated as a Surveyor Engineer at the National University of La Plata, and after being doing this job for two years, in 2021 I made the decision to study "Programmer Analyst" at the Faculty of Informatics and took my first steps in programming.

☕️ In 2022, with the fundamentals that I obtained from the first year of college, I began to delve into web development and opted for the backend path. I took REST API development courses and bootcamps with Java and Spring.

🧠 I am currently in my 2nd year of college, learning how to implement microservices architecture with Java and Spring Cloud, and studying the Angular Framework on my own to better understand how the endpoints of my frontend APIs are consumed.

💼 If you are interested in my profile feel free to contact me and we will arrange an interview!
