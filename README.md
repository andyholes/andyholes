### 👋🏻 Hello! I'm Andres Hoyos Garcia

💡 I have been studying Programmer Analyst since 2021 and working as a backend developer with Java since January 2023.

🚀 I am interested in adding value to the company by creating scalable and secure systems, optimizing performance and ensuring fast response times. My ability to solve problems and collaborate in multidisciplinary teams will contribute to high-quality projects and adaptation to the latest technologies.

🌱 For my future I hope to be able to delve into the business logic and make key decisions at the architectural level, ensuring that the solutions are scalable, efficient and aligned with the company's objectives.
