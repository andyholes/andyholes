#### 👋🏻 Hello! I'm Andres Hoyos Garcia

📆 In 2019 I graduated as a Surveyor Engineer at the National University of La Plata, and after being doing this job for two years, in 2021 I made the decision to study "Programmer Analyst" at the Faculty of Informatics and took my first steps in programming.

☕️ In 2022, with the fundamentals that I obtained from the first year of college, I began to delve into web development and opted for the backend path. I took REST API development courses and bootcamps with Java and Spring.

🧠 I am currently in my 2nd year of college and studying the Angular Framework on my own to be able to consume the endpoints of my APIs with my own frontend developments, and to be able to develop applications in an integral way following the Model View Controller pattern.

💼 If you are interested in my profile feel free to contact me and we will arrange an interview!
